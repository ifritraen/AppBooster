/**
 * Represents the current state of app optimization progress.
 *
 * Business purpose:
 * - Streams live progress for foreground UI and WorkManager notifications.
 * - Exposes a stable [runId] so presentation can associate one-time UI affordances
 *   (e.g., result banners) with a specific optimization run.
 * - Makes the final result explicit via [result] to avoid fragile string-based checks.
 *
 * @property runId Identifier of the current/most recent optimization run.
 * A value of `0L` indicates that no run has been started yet.
 * @property isRunning Whether optimization is currently in progress.
 * @property result Final result of the most recent run.
 * @property currentAppPackage The package name of the app currently being optimized.
 * @property progress Progress value from 0.0 to 1.0.
 * @property processedCount Number of apps already optimized.
 * @property skippedCount Number of apps skipped (already optimized recently).
 * @property totalCount Total number of apps to optimize.
