/**
 * Stops an active optimization run.
 *
 * Business purpose:
 * - Ensures all entry points (UI, notification action, future automation) stop the operation
 *   using the exact same sequence.
 * - Prevents drift where one path cancels WorkManager but forgets repository-side cancellation.
 *
 * Stop semantics:
 * 1) Cancel scheduled foreground work (removes notification / stops Worker).
 * 2) Cancel repository-side in-flight operations and update UI state immediately.
 *
 * @property cancelOptimizationWorkUseCase Cancels WorkManager-backed optimization work.
 * @property cancelOptimizationUseCase Cancels repository-side optimization loop.
